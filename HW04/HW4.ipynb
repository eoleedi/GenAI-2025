        "\n",
        "### **1. Indefinite Articles (\"a/an\" vs. \"en/ett\")**  \n",
        "**English:**  \n",
        "- Uses **\"a\"** before words starting with a consonant sound (e.g., *a car*).  \n",
        "- Uses **\"an\"** before words starting with a vowel sound (e.g., *an apple*).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Swedish:**  \n",
        "- Uses **\"en\"** for common-gender nouns (*en bok* = \"a book\").  \n",
        "- Uses **\"ett\"** for neuter nouns (*ett hus* = \"a house\").  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**  \n",
        "- In English, the article choice depends on pronunciation (vowel/consonant sound), while in Swedish, it depends on the grammatical gender of the noun.  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Definite Articles (\"the\" vs. \"-en/-et\" and \"den/det/de\")**  \n",
        "**English:**  \n",
        "- Uses **\"the\"** before both singular and plural nouns (*the book*, *the books*).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Swedish:**  \n",
        "- The definite article is **attached to the end of the noun**:  \n",
        "  - *bok* (\"book\") → *boken* (\"the book\")  \n",
        "  - *hus* (\"house\") → *huset* (\"the house\")  \n",
        "- For plural definite nouns, the suffix changes:  \n",
        "  - *böcker* (\"books\") → *böckerna* (\"the books\")  \n",
        "  - *hus* (\"houses\") → *husen* (\"the houses\")  \n",
        "- When the noun is modified by an adjective, a **separate** definite article is used:  \n",
        "  - *den stora boken* (\"the big book\")  \n",
        "  - *det lilla huset* (\"the small house\")  \n",

        "    * \"en\" and \"ett\" are used to refer to nonspecific or general nouns. The choice between \"en\" and \"ett\" depends on the noun's gender (common or neuter).\n",
        "    * Example: \"en bil\" (a car), \"ett hus\" (a house).\n",
        "* **Definite Article:**\n",
        "    * Unlike English, Swedish often expresses the definite article by adding a suffix to the noun.\n",
        "    * Example:\n",

        "        * \"huset\" (the house) from \"ett hus\".\n",
        "    * Swedish also uses \"den,\" \"det,\" and \"de\" in some contexts, but the suffixed form is very common.\n",
        "    * For plural nouns Swedish uses \"na\". Example, \"böckerna\" (the books) from \"böcker\" (books)\n",

        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Formation of the Definite Article:**\n",
        "    * English uses a separate word (\"the\").\n",
        "    * Swedish primarily uses suffixes attached to the noun.\n",
        "* **Gender:**\n",
        "    * English indefinite articles change based on the following word's sound (\"a\" vs. \"an\").\n",
        "    * Swedish indefinite articles change based on the grammatical gender of the Noun (\"en\" vs \"ett\").\n",
        "* **Plural definite articles:**\n",
        "    * English uses \"the\" for singular and plural.\n",
